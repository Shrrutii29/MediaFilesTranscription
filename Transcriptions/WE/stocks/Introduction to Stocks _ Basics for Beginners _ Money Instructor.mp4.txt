 Hey DJ, what are you up to today? I'm just trying to understand stocks and how to invest in them, you know. Like, it's also confusing and I want to make sure I know what I'm doing. Have you heard of them before? Yeah, aren't they like pieces of paper or something that people buy in sell? Yeah, it is something like that. Stocks represent ownership in a company. When you buy a stock, you are essentially buying a small piece of that company. Oh, I see. So probably then if the company does well, the value of the stock should go up and the person who owns it can sell it for a profit. Yeah, pretty much. And if the company doesn't do well, the value of the stock may go down. People who invest in stocks hope to make money by buying stocks that will hopefully increase in value over time. That sounds a bit like a risky way to make money. Yeah, it can be risky, but it can also be a good way to build wealth over the long term. That is why it's important to do your research and carefully consider the risks before investing. Since there are many different types of stocks, it's important to choose the right ones for your investment portfolio. How do people decide which stocks to buy? There are many factors people consider when choosing stocks. Some people look at a company's financial statements and consider factors such as its revenue, profits, and debt. I like to focus on the company's management team, products or services, and its competitive advantage in the market. It's also important to consider the overall state of the economy and the specific industry that a company operates in. Wow, there's a lot to think about. Yes, there is. That's why many people choose to use a financial advisor or broker to help them make informed investment decisions, instead of doing it themselves. I am trying to learn as much as I can about stocks and investing myself. That makes sense. I also definitely want to learn more about investing. Thanks for explaining all of this to me. Sure. I'm always happy to help when it comes to investing in personal finance.
