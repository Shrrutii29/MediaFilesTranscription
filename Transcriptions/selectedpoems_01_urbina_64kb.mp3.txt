Selected poems by Luis Obina, which craft read by Newgate Nov. I did not hear when you came in. Dark in the shadow of a slow sunset, lay the ancient park of my thoughts, dirt around by sadness as by a wall. I saw you arrive before me like magic, like the marvel of an incantation, like the sweet apparition of a fairy tale, light with the whiteness of snow, and blonde with dresses of pure gold. A breath of April blew through my autumn. On every twig, new leaves budded, in every forsaken nest there was songs, and among the shadows of the garden, wandering fireflies, dreams glittered, as before the latest of my griefs. And if poem, this recording is in the public domain.
